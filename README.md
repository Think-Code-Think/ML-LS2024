# Machine Learning Course - Learners' Space

This repository contains all the assignments and projects completed during the Machine Learning Course under Learners' Space, organized by the Web and Coding Club. The course spans four weeks, each focusing on different aspects of machine learning and deep learning.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories, each corresponding to a week of the course:

- **Week_1**: Basics of Python, NumPy, Pandas, Linear and Logistic Regression
- **Week_2**: Various Classifiers, Basics of TensorFlow and PyTorch, Simple Neural Network, YOLOv8 Model
- **Week_3**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Image Processing using OpenCV
- **Week_4**: Final Project - Multi-Class Medical Image Classification using HAM10000 Dataset

## Week 1: Basics of Python, NumPy, Pandas, Linear and Logistic Regression

In the first week, we focused on building a solid foundation in Python programming and essential libraries for data manipulation and analysis. We covered:
- Basics of Python programming
- Introduction to NumPy and Pandas
- Implementation of Linear Regression and Logistic Regression

## Week 2: Classifiers, TensorFlow and PyTorch Basics, Simple Neural Network, YOLOv8 Model

The second week introduced us to various classifiers and deep learning frameworks. Key topics include:
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees & Random Forest
- Basics of TensorFlow and PyTorch
- Implementation of a simple neural network to classify images into two classes: Bart and Homer
- Understanding and implementing the YOLOv8 model to classify and detect various car parts

## Week 3: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Image Processing using OpenCV

In the third week, we delved into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and image processing techniques. Highlights of the week:
- Understanding CNN architectures and their applications
- Learning image processing using OpenCV
- Practical implementations and experiments with CNN models

## Week 4: Final Project - Multi-Class Medical Image Classification

The final week was dedicated to a comprehensive project where we developed a model for multi-class medical image classification using the HAM10000 dataset. The project included:
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Model design and training
- Evaluation and performance metrics
